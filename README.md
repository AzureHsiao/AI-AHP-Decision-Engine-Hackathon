# AI-AHP-Decision-Engine-Hackathon
A Python-based AHP decision engine that automates pairwise comparison matrices, calculates criteria weights, runs sensitivity analysis, and visualizes decisions. Built for hackathon use and real-world decision-making frameworks.

# AI-Powered AHP Decision Engine
A lightweight portfolio project demonstrating an automated AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) decision-making engine.  
This repository includes the complete Jupyter Notebook implementation and the final presentation from the hackathon project.

---

## Project Overview
This project implements the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) in Python to support structured, quantitative decision-making.  
The notebook automates pairwise comparison matrices, calculates criteria weights using eigenvalue methods, evaluates alternatives, and visualizes results.

The repository contains:
- AHP_DecisionEngine.ipynb — full AHP computation workflow  
- Presentation.pdf — summary deck explaining the framework and findings

## Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Pairwise Matrix Automation | Generates AHP comparison matrices based on input values |
| Eigenvalue Weight Calculation | Computes criteria weights, λmax, CI, and CR |
| Alternative Scoring | Produces final rankings for decision alternatives |
| Visual Output | Plots for criteria importance and comparison results |
| Clean Notebook Design | Complete workflow in a single file for easy review |
